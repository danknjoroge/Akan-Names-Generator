                <p>
                    Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a '
                    day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
                </p>

                <h2>How is it assigned?</h2>
                <p>These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul. 
                    The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul</p>
